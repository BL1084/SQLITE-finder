  --table design, its possible to get multiple mobile units in different rnames so we want kill_count to be the top priority here.
  
  SELECT a.name AS name1, b.rname AS rname2, a.zone AS zone1
  FROM mob_database a, mob_database b
  WHERE name1 = "generic_mob_name" AND zone1 = "generic_zone_name" AND rname2 = "generic_room_name";
  
  --made to cater to a specific type of quest. we want to query against the database itself to get a result that satisfies room name but returns the zone and room also.
